## 🎯 Introduction
**Inbox Overload? Let AI Take the Loan!**

Loan servicing emails pile up fast—but why sort them manually? A smart classification model cuts through the clutter, sorting messages faster than a banker counts interest. Quicker replies, happier borrowers, and a workflow smoother than a refinanced mortgage. Let’s get classified!

## 💡 Inspiration

**Why Automate Email Classification?**

Loan servicing emails pour in daily—too many to sort manually without delays and risks. Here’s why automation is a game-changer:

**1. Handle High Volumes with Ease**– AI sorts thousands of emails faster than you can hit “mark as unread.”


**2. Stay Compliant** – Misclassifications can be costly; automation helps keep everything in check.


**3. Speed Up Responses** – Faster replies mean happier borrowers (and fewer follow-ups).


**4. Cut Costs, Boost Productivity** – Let employees focus on work that actually needs a human touch.


**5. Reduce Errors** – No more misrouted or overlooked emails—just smooth operations.


**6. Turn Data into Decisions** – Understand borrower concerns before they escalate.

With automation, we’re streamlining workflows, ensuring compliance, and improving the borrower experience — one smartly sorted email at a time.

## ⚙️ What It Does
With a structured approach, we transform email chaos into clear, actionable insights. Let's dig in to see what our solution does.

**1. Data Collection** – Gather emails in all shapes and formats—because inboxes are anything but uniform.

**2. Rule-Based Classification** – Use predefined rules to sort emails into request types and subcategories—like an AI-powered filing assistant.

**3. Text Preprocessing** – Strip away the fluff (“Regards,” “Sincerely,” and other email formalities) to focus on what really matters.

**4. Tokenization**– Break the text into individual words or “tokens” for analysis—think of it as turning a paragraph into puzzle pieces.

**5. Sentiment Analysis** – Measure how closely the email content matches predefined request-type rules using cosine similarity.

**6. Confidence Score Calculation**– Assign a confidence score based on similarity, ensuring accurate classification before taking action.
