## 💡 Inspiration
Solving this problem of email classification will help in efficiency, compliance, and resolve customer experience challenges. Key reasons that motivated us:

1. High Volume of Emails – Loan servicing companies receive thousands of emails daily, making it difficult to process them manually. Automating classification helps manage this workload efficiently.

2. Regulatory Compliance – Loan servicing is highly regulated, and misclassifying or overlooking critical emails (e.g., borrower disputes, payment issues) can lead to compliance risks and penalties.

3. Improving Response Time – Quick responses to customer queries will improve customer satisfaction and reduce frustration.

4. Reducing Operational Costs – Automating email classification reduces the need for manual sorting, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value tasks.

5. Minimizing Errors – Manual email handling can lead to misrouting, delayed responses, or lost emails. An intelligent classification system improves accuracy and ensures emails are addressed correctly.

6. Enhancing Decision-Making – A well-structured classification system provides insights into common borrower concerns, enabling better resource allocation and proactive issue resolution.
